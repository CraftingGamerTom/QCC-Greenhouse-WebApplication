# QCC Greenhouse Web Application

## Overview
This repository was created to be a home for the code for the PTK Live and Learn Greenhouse. It was a pleasure to work on this project. I learned an incredible amount of useful software engineering tricks that will help me for the rest of my life. I learned more through this than my classes.

Unfortunetly, since this was one of my first major projects, there is a lot of ugly, not well documented, and even bad code that I would prefer to hide away if I could. Maybe I am being a bit harsh on myself. There is a lot of useful information in here. If anyone wishes to take up the project this is a good place to start. Otherwise, you should contact me directly as I continued this project in a private space and it is much prettier now.


## What For?
This project was part of the Data Analytics and Automation Team's effort to bring technology into the greenhouse on campus. We wanted to monitor, record, and understand data. Ultimately we want to understand what plants need in real time.

## Future Work
I continued working on this project in a private space as it began to grow into something bigger that I may persue to scale for more organizations. Unfortunetly, I left this repository as quite a mess. I hope it can be understood, or even better: useful.

I continue to license Phi Theta Kappa with code as it is being developed. Eventually the software will be hosted as a service elsewhere.

If, for whatever reason, I discontinue pursuing the project, I plan to open source the entire thing in a project of some sort for someone to carry the torch. Thanks for the support!

## Info
All licensed style sheets and java script is not included due to license agreements. This is the bare bones of the web application.
